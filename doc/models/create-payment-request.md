| `DelayDuration` | `String` | Optional | The duration of time after the payment's creation when Square automatically cancels the<br>payment. This automatic cancellation applies only to payments that do not reach a terminal state<br>(COMPLETED, CANCELED, or FAILED) before the `delay_duration` time period.<br><br>This parameter should be specified as a time duration, in RFC 3339 format, with a minimum value<br>of 1 minute.<br><br>Note: This feature is only supported for card payments.

| `Autocomplete` | `Boolean` | Optional | If set to `true`, this payment will be completed when possible. If<br>set to `false`, this payment is held in an approved state until either<br>explicitly completed (captured) or canceled (voided).

| `ReferenceId` | `String` | Optional | A user-defined ID to associate with the payment.<br><br>You can use this field to associate the payment to an entity in an external system<br>(for example, you might specify an order ID that is generated by a third-party shopping cart).<br><br>Limit 40 characters.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `40` | String getReferenceId() |
| `VerificationToken` | `String` | Optional | An identifying token generated by `SqPaymentForm.verifyBuyer()`.<br>Verification tokens encapsulate customer device information and 3-D Secure<br>challenge results to indicate that Square has verified the buyer identity.<br><br>For more information, see [SCA Overview](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview). | String getVerificationToken() |
| `AcceptPartialAuthorization` | `Boolean` | Optional | If set to `true` and charging a Square Gift Card, a payment might be returned with<br>`amount_money` equal to less than what was requested.

You might choose<br>to prompt the buyer for an additional payment to cover the remainder or cancel the Gift Card<br>payment. This field cannot be `true` when `autocomplete = true`.<br><br>For more information, see<br>[Partial amount with Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments#partial-payment-gift-card).<br><br>Default: false | Boolean getAcceptPartialAuthorization() |
