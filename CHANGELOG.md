# Change Log

## Version 5.2.1.20200422 (2020-04-22)
## API releases
* **Customer Segments API (beta).** `limit` field removed from **ListCustomerSegments** endpoint.


**Note:** This release fixes a bug introduced on the [April 22, 2020](changelog/connect-logs/2020-04-22) release of the Square API.

## Version 5.1.0.20200325 (2020-03-25)
## Existing API updates
* **[Payments API](${SQUARE_TECH_REF}/payments-api).** In support of the existing [Delayed capture](payments-api/take-payments) for payments, the following fields are added to the [Payment](${SQUARE_TECH_REF}/objects/Payment) type:
   * `delay_duration`. In a [CreatePayment](${SQUARE_TECH_REF}/payments-api/create-payment) request, you can set `autocomplete` to false to get  payment approval but not charge the payment source. You can now add this field to specify a time period to complete (or cancel) the payment. For more information, see [Delay capture](payments-api/take-payments).
   * `delay_action`. Defines the action that Square takes on the payment when the `delay_duration` elapses. In this release, the API supports only the cancel payment action.
   * `delayed_until`. Provides the date and time on Square servers when Square applies `delay_action` on the payment.

## Version 5.0.0.20200226 (2020-02-26)
## API releases
* **GA release**: All SDKs have been updated to support the new Bank Accounts and CashDrawerShifts APIs.

* **Beta release**: All SDKs have been updated to support the new Disputes API.


## Existing API updates

All SDKs have been updated to support the following changes:

* **Catalog API**    
  * Batch upsert catalog objects endpoint &mdash; The `batches` field is now required and the array must have at least one element.   
  * CatalogModifier &mdash; Two fields added:
     * `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a modifier list   
     * `modifier_list_id` to reference the parent modifier list
  * CatalogModifierList &mdash; New field added: `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a list of **CatalogModifierList** objects.

* **Customers API changes**
  * SearchCustomers endpoint &mdash; `limit` size reduced from 1000 to 100 to improve the endpoint performance. 

* **Orders API changes**
  * CreateOrderRequest &mdash; Previously these request fields were deprecated: `line_items`, `taxes`, `discounts`. These fields are no longer available. Instead you now use the `Order` object in the request. For example, `Order.line_items`, `Order.taxes`, and `Order.discounts`.
  * OrderLineItem type &mdash; There are two changes:
    * The `taxes` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_taxes` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemTax.scope` field. 
    * The `discounts` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_discounts` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemDiscount.scope` field. 

* **Shared object updates**
  * **Card object** &mdash; New fields added: `card_type`, `prepaid_type`. Currently, only the Payments API responses populate these fields. 

## Version 4.1.0.20200122 (2020-01-22)
* New field:  The **Employee** object now has an `is_owner` field.
* New enumeration:  The **CardBrand** enumeration has a new `SQUARE_CAPITAL_CARD` enum value to support a Square one-time Installments payment.

* New request body field constraint: The __Refund__ Payment request now requires a payment_id. 

## Version 4.0.0.20191217 (2019-12-17)
* Square is excited to announce the public release of customized SDK for Java

* __GA release:__ SDKs updated to support new `receipt_url` and `receipt_number` fields added to the  [Payment](${SQUARE_TECH_REF}/objects/Payment) type.  

* __Beta release:__ SDKs updated to support the new [CashDrawerShifts](cashdrawershift-api/reporting) API.

* Square now follows the semantic versioning scheme for all SDKs except PHP and Node.js. This versioning scheme uses three numbers to delineate MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions of our SDK. In addition, the SDK version also includes the API version so you know what Square API version the SDK is related to. For more information, see [Versioning and SDKs](build-basics/versioning-overview#versioning-and-sdks).
* Java, .Net, Python, and Ruby SDKs are now version 4.0.0. Java and .Net SDKs have breaking changes in version 4.0.0. Ruby and Python do not have breaking changes.
